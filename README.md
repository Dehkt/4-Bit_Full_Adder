# 4-Bit Full Adder

## Project Overview
This project implements a 4-bit full adder using VHDL, designed to perform binary addition on two 4-bit input vectors, `A` and `B`, along with a carry-in signal (`Cin`). The architecture utilizes four single-bit full adders to facilitate carry propagation.

## Features
- Supports binary addition of two 4-bit numbers.
- Cascades four single-bit full adders.
- Outputs the sum and carry-out.
